## 2 Pillars of Fun

- Meaning
- Difficulty

Meaning: Addressees should be able to
assign meaning(s) to the commodity they
are using.

Difficulty: The commodity should challenge
addressees in someway or another.
But the challenge should be in a range
that is not too boring or too difficult.
Just the right amount of Difficulty.

I am guessing that: When addresses can
assign more meanings to the commodity,
the difficulty range could be widened.
The more meaning, allow addresses to be
acceptance of boredom or frustration of
challenge.
