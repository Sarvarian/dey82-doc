# Game

A setup for play.
    A setup for fooling around.
    A setup for a story.
        A setup for voluntary attention to act of fooling around.

Environment, Rules, Boundaries.

I think:
Games are about learning and playing is
learning. When there is nothing to learn,
There is no motivation to continue playing.
